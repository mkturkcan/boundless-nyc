//       body near, connectors included;
//   (2) a body already inside the car ahead was dropped as its leader (the gap had to be over -2 m) and was driven

//   (3) an OV32 sweep that met a body it already overlapped at its start (a stack, a spawn) waited for it for ever: a body

// outer half) and the body centre must be off every non-road surface at the car's level. A failing shape is replaced by
// the best passing one of a family of asymmetric handles (0.15-1.25 x the chord) with the controls swung 1 m inside to 3 m

// passes, the connector is refused: the car stays at its mouth and takes another continuation, and that continuation is
// struck from the choices of every car in that lane (a one-way arm left with no way out stands its car down as a dead car,
