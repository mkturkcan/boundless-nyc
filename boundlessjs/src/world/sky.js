  //     and a uniform darkening to the photograph's mean only reaches 12.6 % because the frame needs
  //     shadow STRUCTURE, not gain. 128 cross-lights the grid (walls facing 119 lit, 209 at 0.16 fill,

  //     where the measured plate sits, so the frame no longer drifts while the camera holds.

// are bit-identical by construction. Why each one:
//   sun 2.5 -> 4.0 with hemi 0.80 -> 1.55 / bnc 1.5 -> 0.42: the r14 plates put 0.0-0.1 % of frame
//     above L 200 against the Earth crops' 6.3-12.1 %, with p95 175-185 against 207-219. The live
//     rig tone-maps with **AgX** (public/settings/graphics.json overrides weather.js's ACES default
//     at main.js:426, BEFORE `?gfx=`), whose base look is a flat 16.5-stop sigmoid worth ~25 sRGB per
//     stop at the top; under the old grade (contrast 0.5, definition 0.32, sharpness 0.45) the post
//     chain put the punch back, and `clean=1` — correctly — takes all three away. So the top end has
//     to come from the LIGHT: a bigger key on a smaller fill, which is also the only thing that
//     widens p5-p95 (117-126 against Earth's 152-175) without moving the mean.
//   the fill is also RECOLOURED, not just cut: the r13 rig's hemi (cool, 0.32 irradiance) and urban
//     bounce (warm, 0.45) summed to (0.554,0.504,0.490) — dead neutral, R over B — which is why the
//     L30-70 band reads B-R -10..+5 against the photograph's +17..+29 and the shaded Amsterdam walk
//     renders olive. Trading the warm bounce for the blue hemi takes the fill to B/R ~1.8.
//   sunW 0.26 puts the warmth back where it physically belongs. The day key saturates to a neutral
//     0xfffcf7 by elev 42 (trans*1.3 = 1.06), so ALL the warmth in sunlit concrete was coming from
//     the ground shader's albedo calibration, which necessarily warmed the shade too. A warm sun on
//     a neutral albedo with a blue sky fill is the only structure that reads R>B in sun AND B>R in
//     shade at once (materials.js ENV.lb14StCal is the other half of this change).
//   expoK 0.72 -> 0.58 deliberately PINS the auto-exposure meter at its 0.70 clamp floor, so the
//     bigger key sticks instead of being handed a third of the way back every frame (LB13 tuned
//     0.72 to sit at the loop's unpinned equilibrium, which makes the rig a negative feedback on
//     exactly the change this round needs).
//   conFloor 0.26 is a day-only FLOOR on the grade's contrast, so `clean=1` (contrast 0.10) gets a
//     real S-curve while the un-cleaned day preset keeps graphics.json's 0.5 untouched.
//   hemiC deepens the day sky-fill colour (0x9db9de is B/R 2.17; 0x8fb6e4 is 2.82) — day only, so
//     golden keeps 0x9db9de.
// SWEEP 1 (docs/notes/lb14.md 19:25, wbEarthBedford, 12 variants in one page) settled three things:
//   * L>200 tracks the KEY, not the grade: 0.6 / 2.5 / 5.3 % of frame at sun 3.2 / 4.0 / 4.8, against
//     0.0 % on the shipped v19 plate and 10.1 % on the Earth crop. conFloor 0.10 -> 0.26 is worth
//     +0.1 pp of that, i.e. a third of one sun step; it is a real but small part of the fix.
//   * expoK 0.58 pins the meter at its 0.70 clamp floor (meterAvg 0.197-0.212 against a 0.116 target),
//     so the key increase sticks and the rig stops drifting while a camera holds.
//   * the fill RECOLOURING did nothing: hemi 0.32 -> 0.63, bnc 0.45 -> 0.12 and a bluer hemi colour
//     left the L30-70 band at B-R +1, identical to r13. By day the ambient is carried by the auto
//     light PROBE (a cube capture of the scene, so it re-photographs a neutral city) and SSGI (bounce
//     off warm brick) — hence probeK/giK below, and `coolSh` for the measured remainder.
// SWEEP 2 then added the one that decided the shadow hue: on an Earth pose, setting probeK AND giK to
// ZERO moves the L30-70 band from B-R +6 to +5. Not the hemi, not the bounce, not the probe, not SSGI.
// The chroma is being eaten by **AgX's outset matrix** — the same rig renders a key whose LINEAR R/B
// is 1.27 as a bright band at B-R -5, i.e. about a third of the chroma survives the tone map. So
// probeK/giK are back at values that do not cost eye-level brightness for nothing, `satFloor` gives
// some of the chroma back globally, and the remainder is carried by `coolSh` — the grade's OWN shadow
// split (shW = 1 - smoothstep(0.10, 0.72, luma)), run negative because real NYC shade is sky-filled.
// SWEEP 3 (eye level, amst120N) fixed the two faults the lead caught in FD14's 18:44 plates:
//   * `gao` (the city-AO gate) -> 0: it halves a canyon ground's indirect diffuse (-1.1 stops, the
//     shaded carriageway fell from L 78 to L 51) and CANNOT do the job it was added for, because the
//     bake is 14.3 x 19.8 m per texel and darkens walk and roadway equally.
//   * `bnc` is the over-blueing. The urban bounce is the only warm term in a canyon's fill and at eye
//     level it is a large share of it (at 150 m it is nothing). Cutting it to 0.28 took the shaded
//     carriageway's linear B/R to 7.22 against the reference's 2.77.
