# Development and quality checks

BoundlessNYC changes in small steps that each stay reversible and measurable. Three mechanisms keep a change from
breaking the city: every visible change sits behind a URL flag that turns it off, recorded takes pass automated render
gates before anyone uses them, and a release passes its own gates before it is published. This page describes each
mechanism and the commands that run it. All commands run from the top of a source checkout.

## Features behind URL flags

There is no central flag registry: each module reads `location.search` itself. A new feature is on by default and is
turned off with its tag set to `0`, which restores the previous behaviour exactly:

```js
// city/groundFix38.js
const Q = typeof location !== 'undefined' ? new URLSearchParams(location.search) : null;
export const GF38 = !(Q && Q.get('gf38') === '0');
```

Tags are two letters and the round number, for example `?gf38=0` (the ground fill on 125th Street), `?st38=0` (the
subway entrances) and `?tn38=0` (junction turns kept on the carriageway). A feature that is off by default tests for
`=== '1'` instead (`?bxtrees=1`). The flag is named in the file's comment and in the commit subject, so a regression
can be bisected by turning flags off in the URL, for example `http://127.0.0.1:5219/?gf38=0&tn38=0`, without
checking out older code. Node tools that import a module have no `location`, so every flag is on there.

## Tests

```bash
(cd boundlessjs && npm test)                          # geometry and tiling invariants, 81 checks
python -m unittest discover -s PythonAPI/tests        # the Python package; offline
BOUNDLESS_TEST_PORT=2000 python -m unittest discover -s PythonAPI/tests   # adds the tests that need a running server
```

`npm test` needs the compiled tiles. It checks wall winding and, on sampled tiles, that terrain heights are finite,
building rings are counter-clockwise and triangulable, roads do not sink into the terrain and bridge decks are finite
with clearance under them. It exits 1 on any failure.

## Render gates

Rendering defects (z-fighting, shimmering, pop-in, black blocks from non-finite pixels, vehicles off the road, a camera
passing through geometry) are hard to see in single frames, so the film tools check every recorded take. A take is
the sequence of frames of one camera path (a shot in `tools/ad/shots.json`), recorded by `tools/ad/record.mjs` into
`boundlessjs/shots/ad/clips/<shot>/`. Each harness renders on a GPU lane (`GPU_LANE=n` uses GPU (n − 1) mod the
number of GPUs; jobs on one lane queue on a lock, see `tools/gpulock.mjs`) and stops at a deadline
(`tools/harness_guard.mjs`, exit 124).

**While recording.** `record.mjs` logs, per take: `FROZEN` (the render loop stopped; the page is reloaded),
`INVALID` (no tiles under the lens), `RE-SHOT` (frames with a black half, recorded again), `LENS-INSIDE` (the lens
inside a walker or vehicle), `CAR-JUMP` (a vehicle in view moved further than its speed allows), `CAR-OVERLAP` (two
vehicle bodies in view overlap by 0.1 m or more), `CAR-OFFROAD` (a moving vehicle's wheel or body centre on a sidewalk,
median, planting bed or plaza) and `REFLECTION-DROPOUT` (a water mirror losing its reflection). These lines do not set
the exit code; the clearance audit below is the vehicle gate. After every take of 8 frames or more the recorder runs
the artifact scan and prints `*** QA FAILED` and exits 3 when it fails.

**Artifact scan.** `tools/ad/qa_scan.py` looks for transient black blocks, the signature of a non-finite pixel spread
by the post-processing chain, and runs the temporal checks:

```bash
python3 tools/ad/qa_scan.py boundlessjs/shots/ad/clips t7ArchSoffit [--out <dir>] [--json <file>]
```

It exits 2 for a black block, 3 for a temporal failure and 0 otherwise. Isolated pops are written as review strips
(frames k − 1, k, k + 1) for a person to look at.

**Temporal scan.** `tools/ad/temporal_scan.py` compares each frame with its neighbours in cells. A take fails (exit 3)
on z-fighting or shimmer (5 or more cells of 80 px changing over 3 levels on slow surfaces in 5 or more frames), on
alternation (a cell toggling frame by frame), on a level-of-detail switch in view, on a pop that coincides with a logged
shadow, probe or capture event, and on a reflection dropout. `--fine` adds the 40 px test used for offline renders
(6 or more cells over 6 levels in 8 or more frames).

```bash
python3 tools/ad/temporal_scan.py boundlessjs/shots/ad/clips t7ArchSoffit --fine
```

**Clearance audit.** `tools/ad/clearance.mjs` replays a take and walks the lens path in steps of at most 8 cm. A shot
fails (exit 3) when the path crosses drawn geometry, passes closer than 0.6 m to it, when two vehicle bodies overlap by
0.15 m or more in view, or when a moving vehicle leaves the carriageway in view. The report and stills go to
`boundlessjs/shots/ar34/film/clearance/<label>/`.

```bash
node tools/ad/clearance.mjs --shot t7ArchSoffit
```

**Ground gaps.** `tools/qa/ground_gaps.mjs` rebuilds the drawn ground of a set of tiles and exits 1 when bare terrain
shows between walks, roadways and plazas (a cluster of 0.25 m² or more, or ground more than 0.5 m below the road).

**Offline renders.** The Blender batch (`boundlessjs/tools/ar34/export/bx_render_all.mjs`, see
[Rendering in Blender Cycles](blender-cycles.md)) gates each Cycles shot. The USD writer exits 4 when coplanar surface
pairs that would z-fight remain in view, unless it runs with `--coplanar warn`, as the batch runs it. The batch stops a
shot right after the USD when more than 100 coplanar pairs remain in view (stage `usd-check`), and after three preview
frames at 8 samples when they differ from the web take (stage `preview-check`), before the full take uses a GPU. After
the take, four checks must pass: colour and lightness against the web take of the same shot (`cyc_vs_web.py`), the
temporal scan with `--fine`, at most 100 unresolved coplanar pairs in view (`bx_fix.json`), and tree crowns without
flicker (`bx_leafcheck.py`). A failing take is marked in its `status.json` and in the batch summary.

## Release gates

A release is staged from the committed state of the development tree and published only after these checks pass:

| Gate | What it checks |
|---|---|
| Drift | the public tree matches the development tree's committed state file by file |
| Content | every staged text file is scanned for terms and material that must not be published, and fails the release on a match |
| Build | the production build of the client has no dynamic import left unbundled (a 404 at run time) |
| Size | the archive is under GitHub's 2 GiB limit for a release asset |
| Start | the built server starts, reports its version, reaches `world ready` and runs `PythonAPI/examples/quickstart.py` to the end |
| Page | the built `Content/`, served as the web demo serves it, loads in headless Chromium with no console error and no failed request |
| Checksums | `SHA256SUMS` for the archive and the wheel |
| Live | after publishing, files fetched from the web demo match the release's `Content/` by hash |
