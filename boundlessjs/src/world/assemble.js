// `ref_lenox.png`, a Harlem block is roughly 40 % white/silver coat, 26 % grey
// EPDM or weathered coat, 22 % gravel ballast and 12 % black tar, and the
// three dark families are what give the reference its (58 .. 227) luminance
// range against our (73 .. 216). Re-rolled at RUNTIME off colorVar, so it needs
// no recompile and no new tile bit. Bias by class: offices and lofts keep more
// grey/ballast, pre-war walk-ups keep more coating (they are recoated often).

// FAC8 COPING BAND — the horizontal cap on top of a parapet, as its own
// annulus between the parapet's outer and inner rings.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS (docs/notes/facades-r8.md §1, the round's biggest single find):
// the old parapet emitted `roofFill(rp, topY + ph)` over the WHOLE inset ring,
// so the plane you saw from above was the parapet's top at topY + 0.55..1.15,
// not the roof. The deck at topY was sealed under a lid; the rooftop engine
// claims every prop at topY, so the entire roofscape — AC banks, ducts,
// skylights, hatches, vents — was BURIED, and only bulkheads, tanks and
// chimneys poked through. That is the whole of "our roofs are bare white slabs
// with 1-3 boxes": the props were always there, under the roof.
//
// The cap is 2 tris per edge and takes its own membrane family so the roofline
// draws as a line: 60 % pale stone/precast (pavers, membId 4) and 40 % dark
// metal (tar, membId 2), which is what `ref_lenox.png` shows. No coplanar pair
// is created — the band is a horizontal face bounded by the two vertical
// parapet skins, edge to edge (zfight.md §6: overlap, never abut, and never a
// tie).
// The coping's own vertical FACE. A flat annulus is invisible from the street:
// the camera is below the roof plane, so a zero-thickness horizontal band shows
// nothing at all and the roofline reads as a knife edge — which is exactly what
// `harlem125` showed on the first fac8 pass, with the parapet landing correctly
// and being indistinguishable from the wall because it is (correctly) flush with
// it. A real coping is a 0.08-0.12 m stone standing ~45 mm proud of the parapet,
// and that 45 mm of shadow is the whole roofline read from the pavement.
// Flagged as ROOF so it takes the coping's membrane family rather than the wall
// colour: on a vertical face `rp = vWP.xz` barely varies over 0.09 m of height,
// so the membrane resolves to a near-flat tone, and the pavers family's 0.6 m
// grid lands as vertical joints along the run — coping stones, by accident of

// 100 W 125th St (2017, class K, 15 m, block-long, an OSM gap-fill) rendered as
// a blank tan brick box with sparse punched windows. The real building is a
// glazed base with a signage band, an upper facade of metal / fibre-cement
// rainscreen panels with few or no windows, and a parapet.
//
// It is built from FOUR PRISMS AND FOUR BANDS rather than a shader branch,
// because materials.js is shared by every facade family and a style id
// above 12 reaching its windowed branch inherits PROJECT_BRICK red brick
// (`style > 11.5` in three places — notes §0.1):
//
//   fndY .. y0+sH    non-blind, STOREFRONT flag -> the shader's own storefront
//                    branch: interior-mapped glazing, and above 0.78 * storeH
//                    the generated fascia sign from the 32-slot atlas. That IS
//                    the signage band; this function frames it in metal.
//   y0+sH .. fieldTop  BLIND on every wall -> flat rainscreen field, no
//                    windows, and the blind branch never reads `style` at all.
//   fieldTop .. topY   the same, 15 % darker: the spandrel course under the
//                    parapet that these facades almost always carry.
//   bands            a drip cap over the sign, one or two horizontal panel-
//                    course reveals, and a 0.9 m canopy over the glazing.
//
// Bands are flagged as ROOF surfaces with membrane id 2, which is the r8
// coping's trick: the membrane branch (materials.js, isRoof) paints id 2 as
// smooth dark bitumen at 0.085-0.12 albedo, i.e. a dark metal band — and,
// unlike the facade branch, it is style-independent and needs no window grid.
//
// The mitre rule (facades-r8 §9 open item): a band is emitted only on
// non-blind edges, and extended into the corner ONLY at its far end and only
// when the next edge is also non-blind. Extending both ends would overlap two
// coplanar tops in a d x d square at every corner — an exact z-fight tie —
// and extending into a party wall would push the band through the neighbour.

// the floor at the bottom of the shaft and the parapet where the court meets the roof.

// the outer ring, which is what makes extrudePrism's own rule ("shoelace-positive ring
// => exterior side is (+ez,-ex)") turn the wall quads INTO the court with no new flag.

// The wall. Same facade attributes as a street wall — the shader's windowed branch, the
// building's own colour, style, floor height and bay width — because a court wall IS a
// facade: it is where the interior rooms' legally required light comes from, which is the
// entire reason the court exists. Two deliberate differences: `blindMask: 0`, since
// `b.blind` is a party-wall mask indexed against the OUTER ring's edges and would blind
// arbitrary court edges if reused; and `noStore: true`, because there is no shopfront at
// the bottom of an enclosed light shaft.

  // ======================================================== R12 PER-BLOCK DEALER
  // docs/notes/silhouette-r12.md §3.4. Every per-building choice in this project
  // is an INDEPENDENT DRAW off one byte (colorVar): the wall family is
  // `hash1(cv*511,3)`, the parapet `(cv*7.7)%1`, the coping `(cv*17.3)%1`, the
  // roof template `mulberry(colorVar ^ ring[0])`. Independent draws collide with
  // probability 1/N, and `RECIPES[TENEMENT].mats` has N = 3 — so a THIRD of all
  // adjacent tenement pairs in Harlem draw the same brick family, which is the
  // "run of identical modules" the blind packs keep naming.
  //
  // uniformity-r10 §6 proved the fix on the shop-sign roster and the argument is
  // the same here: a hash can only make a repeat UNLIKELY; a bijection over an
  // ORDINAL makes it impossible. So give every building an ordinal along its
  // block and let the dealt attributes be functions of that ordinal.
  //
  // The ordinal: bucket by a 55 m cell (about one Manhattan block face), sort by
  // the DIAGONAL projection x + z, rank 0,1,2,... Manhattan's grid runs ~29 deg
  // off true north, so a 6 m rowhouse frontage moves (x+z) by 6*(cos29+sin29) =
  // 8.1 m and an 18 m street crossing moves it by 7.0 m: both axes separate
  // cleanly under one projection, and no grid angle has to be assumed. Ties
  // (two buildings at the same projection, e.g. front and rear of one lot) break
  // on the record index so the rank is stable across reloads.
  //
  // KNOWN LIMIT, stated because roofs-r9 §3d hit the identical one: the pass runs
  // per TILE, so a block lying across a tile seam restarts its rank and the two
  // buildings either side of the seam can repeat. That is one pair per ~500 m of
  // city against a third of all pairs today.
